# About
Our team developed a project that implements an AI model to generate musical variations that compliment different situation a player encounters while playing a video game.

# Hierarchy
`ai` contains the Google Colab Python notebook where the musical AI model generates MIDI files that were used in the project
`game` contains the Godot project directory. All the files and assets used in the game demonstration are in here.

# Building the Project
In order to build the project, you would need the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
Then inside the engine, open the `game/project.godot` file.
After opening that, then you can view and inspect all parts of the Godot project from within the Godot editors.

However, if you just want to run the project, then download the executable from Releases.
