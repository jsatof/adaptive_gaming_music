# adaptive_gaming_music
A demonstrative project for game music generated by an AI

# Hierarchy
`ai` contains the Google Colab Python notebook where the musical AI model generates MIDI files that were used in the project
`game` contains the Godot project directory. All the files and assets used in the game demonstration are in here.

# Building the Project
In order to build the project, you would need the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/download).
Then inside the engine, open the `game/project.godot` file.

However, if you just want to run the project, then download the executable from Releases.
